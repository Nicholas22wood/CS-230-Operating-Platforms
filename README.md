1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  For this project we were given a client, The Gaming Room, and they wanted to expand their game to more than just the current Android app it currently runs on. We are tasked    with developing a software design document for them to assess which platform we should develop the game as well as some java application code that shows a progress towards   the final code.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  The thing that I did well in this document is developing the executive summary and design constraints of the project as well as the Domain Model which display how the game   is connected through the functions in classes of the entire project. The domain model is a good overview to see how the program plans to work and what functions are being      used for the system to operate. 

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  Going through the design dicument it really made me look at multiple platforms and gave me more comfortability with software that I have not used before. It also helps the   reader understand why the final choice was made, if someone outside the project were to read the document then they would understand the choices made without too many           questions arising. 

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  The document I would revise or add more information to would be the Evaluation secion. I believe good information was provided but with more detail about the possible          companies that included pricing or more statistical evidence to show their capabilities would improve this portion. 

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  From the request I determined that the user needed something that could be expanded upon but also something that was not relatively exspensive to create. It is always          important to take into consideration the users needs, if they needed something that was not too difficult to create and then you develop something that way too much time     or extra support then they would not be satisfied.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  Reading about what requirements or what standards are available today helped me as well as taking into consideration what the requirements of the project are. I could've     chosen a different platform that may have worked for games that are way different then the type of game we are developing. Figuring out what would be best in general is not    always what is best for your client and even though going through the process of researching each potential solution may seem tedious it is best to find what works best      for the client.
